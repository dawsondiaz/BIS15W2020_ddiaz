### About

This repository houses the code of my journey of learning how to analyze data using `R`, the `tidyverse`, and `shiny`. Throughout the course, I learned how to import and clean raw data, process it using R, and make clean and appealing visuals. Taking the analysis one step further, I applied what I learned to design interactive web applications. None of this would've been possible without the guidance of Dr. Ledford and Rebecca Godwin! 


### Final Project: [CDC Data Viewer](https://github.com/Reaveres/BIS15W2020-CDC-Data-Visualizer)
The CDC Data Visualizer uses bulk mortality data from the [CDC Wonder Database](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) and applies various analysis mechanisms using `R` and, `Shiny` and `ShinyDashboard` to visualize data in a more visually appealing way.
