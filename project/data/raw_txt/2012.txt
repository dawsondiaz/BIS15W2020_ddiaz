Caveats:
"1. Totals and Percent of Total are disabled when data are grouped by a 113 or 130 Cause List because both aggregate and detailed"

"misleading."

"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"3. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"

"4. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"

"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
